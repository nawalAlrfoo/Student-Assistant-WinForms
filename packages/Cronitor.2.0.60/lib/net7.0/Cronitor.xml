             jobs monitor the execution of a backend job(cron job, windows scheduled task, etc).
             This involves tracking the lifecycle of the job - the start_time, end_time and exit_state of the job.
            
             events monitor the health of a system via telemetry events.There is no lifecycle to measure, the occurrence (or absence)
             of healthy/unhealthy events, as well as data passed as custom metrics are used to determine the health of an event monitor.
